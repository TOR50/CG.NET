Mini Project: Finance Management System (C#)

⸻

1. Problem Statement (Verified)

The aim of this project is to develop a menu-driven finance management system using C#, demonstrating the use of classes, functions, loops, conditional statements, and switch-case.
The project is divided into Debit and Credit operations, each handling distinct financial activities related to money outflow and inflow.

2. Project Rules (Validated)
	1.	Two classes are used:
	•	Debit
	•	Credit
	2.	Each class contains exactly four different functions.
	3.	Menu navigation is implemented using switch-case.
	4.	Decision making is implemented using if–else and logical operators.
	5.	Loops are used for repetitive calculations.
	6.	Program executes until the user selects Exit.

3. Class: Debit (Money Outflow Operations)

The Debit class handles financial activities where money is spent, deducted, or restricted.

⸻

Function 1: ATM Withdrawal Limit Validation

Purpose:
To verify whether the withdrawal amount is within the daily ATM limit.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters withdrawal amount.
	•	Daily withdrawal limit is fixed (₹40,000).
	•	If withdrawal amount ≤ limit → allowed.
	•	If withdrawal amount > limit → rejected.

Expected Output:
	•	“Withdrawal permitted within daily limit.”
	•	OR
	•	“Daily ATM withdrawal limit exceeded.”

⸻

Function 2: EMI Burden Evaluation

Purpose:
To determine whether a customer can manage a loan EMI.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters monthly income.
	•	User enters EMI amount.
	•	EMI must not exceed 40% of monthly income.
	•	EMI ≤ 40% → manageable.
	•	EMI > 40% → financial burden.

Expected Output:
	•	“EMI is financially manageable.”
	•	OR
	•	“EMI exceeds safe income limit.”

⸻

Function 3: Transaction-Based Daily Spending Calculator

Purpose:
To calculate total spending from multiple debit transactions.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters number of transactions.
	•	Loop runs for each transaction.
	•	Transaction amounts are summed.

Loop Used:
	•	for or while loop

Expected Output:
	•	“Total debit amount for the day: ₹XXXX”

⸻

Function 4: Minimum Balance Compliance Check

Purpose:
To check whether the account maintains the required minimum balance.

Rules / Logic:
	•	Minimum balance required: ₹2,000.
	•	User enters current balance.
	•	Balance < ₹2,000 → penalty applicable.
	•	Balance ≥ ₹2,000 → compliant.

Expected Output:
	•	“Minimum balance not maintained. Penalty applicable.”
	•	OR
	•	“Minimum balance requirement satisfied.”

⸻

4. Class: Credit (Money Inflow Operations)

The Credit class manages financial activities where money is earned, credited, or accumulated.

⸻

Function 1: Net Salary Credit Calculation

Purpose:
To calculate the net salary credited after deductions.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters gross salary.
	•	Fixed deduction of 10% is applied.
	•	Net salary is calculated.

Expected Output:
	•	“Net salary credited: ₹XXXX”

⸻

Function 2: Fixed Deposit Maturity Calculation

Purpose:
To calculate the maturity amount of a fixed deposit.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters principal, rate of interest, and time period.
	•	Simple interest is calculated.
	•	Maturity amount = Principal + Interest.

Expected Output:
	•	“Fixed Deposit maturity amount: ₹XXXX”

⸻

Function 3: Credit Card Reward Points Evaluation

Purpose:
To calculate reward points based on spending.

Rules / Logic:
	•	User enters total credit card spending.
	•	1 reward point is earned for every ₹100 spent.
	•	Reward points are calculated using division.

Expected Output:
	•	“Reward points earned: XXXX”

⸻

Function 4: Employee Bonus Eligibility Check

Purpose:
To determine bonus eligibility based on salary and experience.

Rules / Logic:
	•	Annual salary ≥ ₹5,00,000
	•	Years of service ≥ 3
	•	Both conditions must be satisfied.

Conditions Used:
	•	Logical AND (&&)

Expected Output:
	•	“Employee is eligible for bonus.”
	•	OR
	•	“Employee is not eligible for bonus.”

⸻

5. Menu System (Confirmed Correct)

Main Menu Options:
	1.	Debit Operations
	2.	Credit Operations
